✨ In this post, I’ll show you how I built Fluxia — an all-in-one AI toolkit using Hugging Face models hosted for free!

💡 **Why I built Fluxia**  
As a student, I needed quick summaries, grammar help, and translations. Instead of using 4 apps, I made one!

### 🔧 Tools Included:
- **Summarizer** – Converts long text into bullet points
- **Paraphraser** – Rewrites in different styles
- **Grammar Checker** – Auto-corrects any errors
- **Translator** – Switches between languages instantly
